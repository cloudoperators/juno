# Supernova Docker Image

This Dockerfile builds a standalone, runnable Supernova image. You can configure application properties using environment variables or by providing a custom appProps.json file via a Docker volume.

## Build the Image

Ensure you are in the root directory, then build the Docker image with:

```bash
docker build -t supernova -f apps/supernova/docker/Dockerfile .
```

## Running the Container

There are two primary methods to run the Supernova container:

### 1. Using a Custom `appProps.json` File

To provide a custom configuration file, mount your `appProps.json` via a Docker volume:

```bash
docker run -v /path/to/your/appProps.json:/appProps.json -p 3010:80 supernova
```

### 2. Using Environment Variables

Alternatively, you can configure the application directly using environment variables:

```bash
docker run -e ENDPOINT="https://alertmanager_url/api/v2" -p 3010:80 supernova
```

### Combining Both Methods

You can also combine both methods by providing a custom appProps.json via a volume and then overriding specific values using environment variables:

```bash
docker run -v /path/to/your/appProps.json:/appProps.json -p 3010:80 -e THEME="theme-light" supernova
```

## Environment Variables

You can customize the Supernova application using the following environment variables:

- **`ENDPOINT`**: Specifies the URL for the Alertmanager API endpoint that the application will interact with.

- **`THEME`**: Determines the visual theme of the application. Available options:

  - `theme-light`: Light theme.
  - `theme-dark`: Dark theme.

- **`FILTER_LABELS`**: An array of labels that will be available in the filter dropdown. These labels allow users to filter alerts based on specific criteria. The `Status` label is included by default, based on the alert status attribute, and cannot be overridden. Example:

```json
["app", "cluster", "cluster_type"]
```

- **`SILENCE_EXCLUDED_LABEL`**: A list of labels that are excluded by default when creating a silence. Users can add these labels through the advanced options in the silence form if needed. Provide these labels as an array of strings. Example:

```json
["pod", "pod_name", "instance"]
```

- **`SILENCE_TEMPLATE`**: An array of pre-defined silence templates that can be used to schedule maintenance windows. Each template is an object with the following properties:

  - **`description`**: A brief description of the template.
  - **`editable_labels`**: An array of strings specifying the labels that users can modify.
  - **`fixed_labels`**: A map containing fixed labels and their corresponding values.
  - **`status`**: The status of the silence.
  - **`title`**: The title of the template.
    Example:

```json
{
  "description": "Weekly maintenance window",
  "editable_labels": ["app", "environment"],
  "fixed_labels": {
    "maintenance": "true",
    "team": "devops"
  },
  "status": "active",
  "title": "Weekly Maintenance"
}
```

- **`PREDEFINED_FILTERS`**: PredefinedFilters are filters applied through TabNavigation in the UI to differentiate between contexts such as Production, QA, and others. They are loaded by default when the application is loaded. The format is a list of objects including name, display name and matchers (map containing matchers as name and expression pairs).
  Example:

```json
[
  {
    "name": "prod",
    "displayName": "Productive System",
    "matchers": {
      "region": "^prod-.*"
    }
  }
]
```

- **`INITIAL_FILTERS`**:

InitialFilters are the filters that are applied when the app is loaded. The filters must be an object where the key is the label and the value are the values to filter on.

Example:

```json
{ "cluster": ["prod-1", "prod-2"], "status": ["critical"] }
```

- **`USERNAME`**:

Username used for forms and API requests.
