# Juno

[![REUSE status](https://api.reuse.software/badge/github.com/cloudoperators/juno)](https://api.reuse.software/info/github.com/cloudoperators/juno)

## Overview

Juno has evolved into a platform that includes tools and libraries for developing Juno-based applications. This platform provides a comprehensive set of utilities to streamline the development process, ensure consistency, and facilitate code sharing across different projects.

### Key Components

- **Design System**: The `ui-components` library offers a consistent set of UI components, styles, and guidelines for building user interfaces.

## Micro Frontends (MFE)

Juno consists of multiple Micro Frontends (MFE) that encapsulate specific functionality and user interface components. Each MFE operates independently and can be integrated into a larger application seamlessly.

### Included Micro Frontends

- `apps/landing-page`
- `apps/user-dashboard`

## Libraries

In addition to Micro Frontends, Juno also includes a set of libraries that provide shared functionality and utilities across different parts of the system. These libraries are designed for reusability and modularity, facilitating consistent development practices and code sharing.

### Included Libraries

- `packages/ui-components`
- `packages/communicator`
- `packages/oidc-lib`
