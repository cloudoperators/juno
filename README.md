Juno has evolved into a platform that includes tools and libraries for developing Juno-based applications. This platform provides a comprehensive set of utilities to streamline the development process, ensure consistency, and facilitate code sharing across different projects.

### Key Components

- **Design System**: The `ui-components` library offers a consistent set of UI components, styles, and guidelines for building user interfaces.
- **OIDC Library**: Provides OpenID Connect (OIDC) support for authentication and authorization in Juno-based applications.
- **Communicator Library**: Facilitates communication between different parts of the application, ensuring efficient data exchange.
- **CLI Tools**: Command-line tools to generate, build, and manage applications and libraries, simplifying the development workflow.

### Applications

Juno includes various applications that showcase the use of its tools and libraries, providing examples and templates for developers.

#### Included Applications

- `apps/example`
- `apps/template`

### Libraries

In addition to applications, Juno also includes a set of libraries that provide shared functionality and utilities across different parts of the system. These libraries are designed for reusability and modularity, facilitating consistent development practices and code sharing.

#### Included Libraries

- `packages/ui-components`
- `packages/communicator`
- `packages/oauth`
