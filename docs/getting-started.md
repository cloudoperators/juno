# Getting Started with Juno

Welcome to the Juno platform! This guide will help you get set up and start using Juno to develop your applications.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following software installed on your machine:

- **Node.js** (version 18 or higher)
- **npm** (version 6 or higher)
- **Git**

## Setup

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/cloudoperators/juno.git
   cd juno
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install -f
   ```

3. **Available Turbo Commands:**
   - **Build:**
     ```bash
     npm run turbo build
     ```
   - **Lint:**
     ```bash
     npm run turbo lint
     ```
   - **Test:**
     ```bash
     npm run turbo test
     ```
   - **Dev:**
     ```bash
     npm run turbo dev
     ```
   - **Clean:**
     ```bash
     npm run turbo clean
     ```

You can also install Turbo globally and run the commands directly:
```bash
npm install -g turbo
turbo build
```
Or just use `npx`:
```bash
npx turbo build
```

We emphasize using Turbo commands for most tasks to ensure consistency and efficiency. The Juno project follows a monorepo pattern, facilitating shared dependencies and streamlined development across multiple packages.
