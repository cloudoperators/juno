# Proposal: Carbon Dashboard - Modulith Architecture

**Date:** 2024-09-24  
**Author(s):** UI Team  
**Status:** Draft

---

## 1. Problem Statement

To create a new **Modulith Dashboard**, we need a flexible and scalable architecture that supports the integration of third-party extensions. The architecture should combine the benefits of modularity with the stability of a monolithic system, allowing for easy maintenance, upgrades, and adaptability to future requirements.

_Example:_

> The new Modulith Dashboard must enable seamless updates, interchangeable components, and third-party integrations while maintaining performance and stability.

---

## 2. Objectives & Goals

- Develop a hybrid architecture ("modulith") that provides both modularity and the stability of a monolithic system.
- Ensure seamless third-party extension integration without compromising system performance.
- Provide a clear separation of concerns between core functionality, modules, and third-party extensions.
- Leverage modern tools (TypeScript, Vite, Vitest) to improve developer experience and reduce build/test times.
- Create an architecture that can easily evolve with changing business needs and technology advancements.

---

## 3. Constraints & Assumptions

**Constraints:**

- The architecture must support both static and dynamic integrations.
- Development must prioritize stability and performance even with third-party extension integration.
- There should be guidelines for third-party developers to ensure compatibility and maintain system integrity.

**Assumptions:**

- Third-party developers will create extensions that adhere to isolation and error-handling guidelines.
- The development team has expertise in TypeScript, Vite, and Vitest to implement the new architecture.
- The design can accommodate varying loads and demands as user traffic increases.

## 4. Proposed Solutions

### 4.1 Solution 1: Modulith Architecture (Code Name: "Carbon")

**Description:**

The proposed solution involves building the Modulith Dashboard with a **modulith** architecture—combining the stability of a monolithic core with modular flexibility for future development and third-party extensions. The architecture will be separated into **Core**, **Modules**, and **Extensions**, each serving distinct purposes while remaining integrated.

**Pros:**

- High modularity without sacrificing performance.
- Enables third-party extensions to integrate seamlessly with minimal impact on the core system.
- Provides flexibility with interchangeable core modules.
- Uses modern tools (TypeScript, Vite, Vitest) to streamline development and testing.

**Cons:**

- More complex than a traditional monolithic or fully modular architecture.
- Higher learning curve for third-party developers needing to isolate extensions.

**Evaluation:**

This solution provides the optimal balance between stability and modularity, ensuring long-term flexibility while maintaining the dashboard’s performance. The use of modern tools and frameworks also improves developer experience and productivity.

### 4.2 Solution 2: Fully Modular Architecture

**Description:**

A fully modular approach where each component (core, modules, extensions) is independently deployed, providing even more flexibility in development, integration, and scaling.

**Pros:**

- Maximum flexibility and separation of concerns.
- Independent deployment allows for faster iteration of individual components.
- Easy to scale individual components based on needs.

**Cons:**

- Increased system complexity due to the need to orchestrate and manage multiple independent components.
- Greater risk of performance issues due to increased communication overhead between modules.

**Evaluation:**

While providing maximum modularity, this solution increases complexity and operational overhead. For the dashboard's current needs, it may introduce unnecessary risks to system performance.

---

## 5. Discussion & Feedback

- **Team Feedback:** Developers support using TypeScript and Vite due to improved tooling and better type safety. However, there are concerns about guidelines for third-party integrations to maintain system stability.
- **Stakeholder Comments:** The business team emphasizes the need for third-party extension support but raises concerns about performance overhead and maintaining stability.

---

## 6. Recommendation

The recommended solution is the **Carbon Modulith Architecture**. It provides a balance between flexibility and stability, allowing for third-party extensions while maintaining the performance and security of the core system. The architecture's design accommodates future scalability and component interchangeability without unnecessary complexity.

---

## 7. Next Steps

- Develop a prototype for the Carbon architecture to validate core and module interaction.
- Define integration guidelines for third-party extensions (e.g., isolation requirements, error boundaries).
- Prepare a detailed project plan for implementing the new architecture.
