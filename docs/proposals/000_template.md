# Proposal: [Title of the Proposal]

**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD  
**Author(s):** [Names of those contributing to the proposal]  
**Status:** Draft | Under Review | Finalized

---

## 1. Problem Statement

Clearly describe the problem or issue that needs to be addressed. This should be a concise description of the core challenge or requirement.

_Example:_

> The application needs to support real-time collaboration features, but our current architecture is not designed for this. We need to evaluate potential solutions for adding real-time functionality.

---

## 2. Objectives & Goals

Outline the desired outcome or the key goals of the decision. This helps to frame the evaluation of the different solutions and ensure alignment with project objectives.

_Example:_

- Enable real-time collaboration with minimal latency.
- Ensure scalability for thousands of concurrent users.
- Minimize impact on existing systems and architecture.
- Stick to budget and time constraints.

---

## 3. Constraints & Assumptions

Document any technical, operational, or business constraints that will impact the decision, along with any assumptions that are being made.

_Example:_

**Constraints:**

- The system must integrate with the existing monolithic application.
- Deployment timeline is six months.

**Assumptions:**

- Current infrastructure can handle additional load.
- Real-time features will require low-latency solutions like WebSockets.

---

## 4. Proposed Solutions

List out the different possible solutions for addressing the problem. Each solution should have a clear explanation, pros and cons, and a brief evaluation of how well it addresses the goals and constraints. You can add as many options as needed.

### 4.1 Solution 1: [Title of the Solution]

**Description:**

Provide a detailed description of the solution.

_Example:_

> Implement real-time functionality using WebSockets with a Redis-backed Pub/Sub system to manage message broadcasting.

**Pros:**

- High performance and low latency.
- Scalable to handle thousands of concurrent connections.

**Cons:**

- Complexity in managing connection lifecycles.
- Increases infrastructure costs due to Redis and additional servers.

**Evaluation:**

> This solution is the most performant but may introduce higher operational complexity and cost.

## 5. Discussion & Feedback

Capture any feedback, questions, or concerns regarding the proposed solutions. This section is for recording ongoing discussion points and helps ensure everyoneâ€™s perspectives are taken into account.

_Example:_

- **Team Feedback:** Concerns were raised about the cost of using third-party services for real-time functionality.
- **Stakeholder Comments:** Need to confirm whether Redis scaling costs will be sustainable over time.

---

## 6. Recommendation

Based on the evaluation of the proposed solutions, document the recommended approach here. This section may not be filled out immediately and can be updated as the discussion progresses.

_Example:_

> The recommended solution is to implement WebSockets with a Redis Pub/Sub system due to its scalability and performance, despite the additional infrastructure complexity.

---

## 7. Next Steps

Outline the next steps, such as additional research, prototyping, or stakeholder approval, to move forward with the decision-making process.
Link to ADR that follows this proposal.

_Example:_

- Conduct a prototype with WebSockets to validate performance.
- Finalize infrastructure costs for Redis scaling.
