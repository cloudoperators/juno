# Decision Document: Monorepo Adoption

## Overview

The decision to adopt a monorepo structure for our projects is driven by the need for improved dependency management, task performance, and a streamlined release process. This document outlines the motivation and decision points.

## Motivation for Monorepo

The decision to adopt a monorepo is driven by the following considerations:

- **Simplified Dependency Management:** Using internal dependencies within the monorepo simplifies version handling and enhances the development experience.
- **Improved Task Management and Performance:** Enhancing task management and improving performance through effective caching mechanisms during development.
- **Streamlined Release Process:** Preparing packages for release with a standardized and efficient workflow.

## Decision Points

To achieve these goals, the following decisions have been made:

1. **Dependency Management:**

   - Internal dependencies within the monorepo will be marked with `*` to streamline development processes. Within the monorepo, internal dependencies are marked with _ to streamline development processes. This notation signifies that the referenced packages are internal to the monorepo. When preparing a package for publication, these _ placeholders are replaced temporarily with the appropriate version numbers before the packages are published to npm.

2. **Tool Adoption:**

   - Adoption of `turborepo` is proposed to optimize task management and leverage caching for performance improvements.

3. **Release Management:**

   - The `changeset` CLI tool will be used to manage versioning and changelogs for packages within the monorepo. It will streamline the process of tracking changes, updating versions, and generating changelogs for releases.
