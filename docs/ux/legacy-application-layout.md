# Legacy Application Layout

In some applications built with earlier versions of Juno, the top level navigation will be a horizontal header navigation just underneath the page header. These are considered legacy. Juno still supports this deprecated type of navigation in order to keep those older applications running.

**Using a horizontal header navigation as top level navigation is non-compliant and strongly discouraged.**

Support for this type of navigation could be dropped with any new major release of Juno at any time.
