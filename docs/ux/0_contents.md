# Juno UI UX Documentation

This is a WIP outline of the Juno UX/UI documentation. The contents is created along the outline, while the outline may be subject to change.

Existing sections will be linked in the ToC below, non-linked sections are still to be created.

As long as the outline may change any minute, do not add numbers to the respective file names, we can add these later once we have established confidence in a structure and its ability to scale.
