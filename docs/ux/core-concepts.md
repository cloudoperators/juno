# Core Concepts

As a design system for building consistent, data-dense user interfaces for technical applications, Juno embraces a few key core concepts:

## Flexibility

Juno aims to provide maximum flexibility for users. Owing to the technical nature of the applications to be built with Juno.

## Consistency

Juno aims to provide components, patterns and guidelines to allow for creating consistent user interfaces and experiences.

## Extensibility

Juno is designed to be flexible and modular. Users may use it to its full potential, use it partially, or combine and integrate it freely with components of their own design or choosing, and never lock users in.

## Open Source

Juno is open source.

## Micro-Frontend Support

Juno also supports Micro-Frontend architectures to cater for a variety of technical or organisational requirements.

## Re-Usable Patterns and Components

All components and patterns included with Juno are generally usable and should provide value beyond supporting highly specialised, single-application requirements. The components are building blocks to help create complex, technical apps.

## Backend Technology Agnosticism

Juno UI is not bound to and does not expect a specific backend technology or stack.

## Themeability

Juno UI applications and components support customizing/theming, currently via CSS variables. Full themeability is planned, but not yet implemented.
